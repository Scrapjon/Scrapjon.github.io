Hey, 
If you are reading this you have found (or been given) my portfolio!
Essentially this portfolio is going to be made up of two parts:
1. Serious projects that I'm proud of.
2. Dumb things I make that I find funny and use to show off my personality.
3. Anything that I believe doesn't quite fit the previous two categories.

Anyway, for the full experience I'd recommend you head on down to scrapjon.github.io/index.html
