        <p>During my time in the Game Art, Design, and Programming course at Swinburne, I worked on the game Dreamslayer as a year-long project using <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5">Unreal Engine 5</a>. My main contributions to the project were:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Developing, testing, and debugging enemy AI and behaviors based on the framework provided by <a href="https://github.com/EvelynSchwab">Evelyn Schwab</a>.</li>
            <li>Development of a system allowing enemies to jump between platforms on different elevations.</li>
            <li>Development and modification of query systems for enemy AI.</li>
            <li>Developing, testing, and debugging ability systems for enemy characters.</li>
            <li>Implementation of all in-game sounds using Unreal Engine's MetaSounds.</li>
            <li>Sound design for abilities.</li>
            <li>Composing the game's soundtrack.</li>
            <li>Leading and managing a team during the design process of the enemies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The credits given to me were:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lead AI Developer</li>
            <li>Sound Designer</li>
