        <p>During my time in the Game Art, Design and Programming course at Swinburne, I worked on the game Dreamslayer as a year-long project.<br>
        In this project, we were to use <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5">Unreal Engine 5</a>
        My main contributions to the project were:
    <ul>
        <li>Developing, testing and debugging enemy AI and behaviours based around the framework provided by <a href="https://github.com/EvelynSchwab">Evelyn Schwab</a>.</li>
        <li>Development of a system which allows enemies to jump between platforms on different elevations.</li>
        <li>Development and modification of query systems for enemy AI</li>
        <li>Developing, testing and debugging of ability systems to be used by enemy characters.</li>
        <li>Implimentation of every sound within the game using Unreal Engine's MetaSounds.</li>
        <li>Sound design for abilities.</li>
        <li>Composing the game's soundtrack.</li>
        <li>Leading and managing a team during the design process of the enemies.</li>
    </ul>
    The title's given to me in the credits of Dreamslayer were:
    <ul>
        <li>Head AI Developer</li>
        <li>Sound Designer</li>
        <li>Composer? (Change later)</li>
    </ul>
