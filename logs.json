        "content": "By: William T. \"Wet Sock\" (Age: Unrecorded)\nLocation: Sector 4A, Suburbia West HOA District\nDate of Event: 03/25/2025\n00:00 — Arrival\nEmerging from the storm drain near Lot 17, I initiated crawl-sequence protocol and arrived at the rendezvous point near Jake mailbox (which is still on fire from prior ladder operations; unknown if intentional). Ambient humidity was acceptable. The moon glistened like a cold piss puddle.\nI was greeted by:\nJake “the Reckless” (39M, visibly sweating)\nBig Donkey Keith, wearing a chest harness made from bike chains and yelling about \"reclaiming wetness rights\"\nMarcus “The Mind Plague”, shirtless, whispering to a mason jar labeled “Steve’s Regret”\nOliver “The Prophet”, balancing on a croquet mallet, eyes fully rolled back\nTom “MeatSleeves”, currently unconscious but flexing in his sleep\nThey were all quite cross about a missing hose nozzle. Jake said:\n“THAT LITTLE DICKLICKER STEVE STOLE MY SPRAY ATTACHMENT AND I SWEAR TO FUCK I’LL LIQUIDATE HIS SHINS”\nEmotionally unstable, but committed.\n00:13 — Objective Defined\nJake presented photographic evidence of Steve (43M, hairline deteriorating) holding a garden hose without a nozzle. Circumstantial but damning.\nOperation “Garden Thunder” initiated. Objective: Reclaim nozzle peacefully unless that fails, in which case “go fucking apeshit,” per Keith.\nI suggested a tactical infiltration through his side fence. Marcus disagreed and suggested “summoning the rain snake.” Noted.\n00:24 — Infiltration Begins\nI entered Steve’s yard via irrigation trench. Clothes dampened for stealth (also my natural state). Jake began shouting immediately, breaching protocol. The group stormed the lawn.\nSteve emerged in a robe and yelled:\n“ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS WEEK YOU PEOPLE NEED TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED”\nUnclear if robe was tactical. Unimportant.\n00:25 — Engagement Escalation\nMarcus attempted diplomacy by releasing 14 mice labeled “Nozzle Inspectors.” Keith headbutted the lawn gnome again (consistent tactic). Oliver recited a passage from the Domino’s Pizza corporate bylaws and vomited foam. Beautiful chaos.\nSteve shouted:\n“WHERE IS BILL?! I KNOW ONE OF YOU FUCKS CAME OUT OF MY DUCT SYSTEM LAST TIME”\nI waved politely. He screamed louder.\n00:31 — Objective Acquired\nWhile the others ranted and rolled in mulch, I quietly entered the garage. Located the nozzle atop a box of unpaid HOA notices. Secured it with minimal resistance, though a raccoon bit my shin (likely unrelated).\nCommenced tactical exit via storm gutter.\n00:35 — Extraction + Casual Encounter\nExited under the trampoline. Steve’s wife saw me and said:\n“Oh Jesus Christ, it’s Wet Sock again.”\nI informed her the property’s hydration levels were “sufficiently sinful.” She began crying.\nRejoined team. Jake kissed the nozzle. Keith screamed “WE’VE RECLAMED THE SPRAYING RIGHTS OF OUR PEOPLE” and immediately began pressure-washing Steve’s begonias.\n00:40 — Casual Curse Deployment\nMarcus left a sigil under Steve’s deck. He says it’ll “make him piss backwards.” I neither confirm nor deny the effectiveness of reverse-urine hexes, but I respect the craft.\n00:44 — Dissolution of Unit\nOperation ended. Everyone scattered when the HOA motion lights turned on. I dissolved into puddle form and re-entered the sewer.\nAs I left, Steve could be heard yelling:\n“FUCK YOU FUCKING WET FREAK I’M GETTING THE YARD BLESSED”\nClosing Notes\nOperation success: nozzle retrieved, suburban dominance reasserted, hydration supremacy re-established. No team members arrested (Tom still unconscious).\nMarcus said this was “only the beginning.” Keith now refers to himself as “the Hoselord.” Jake has begun crafting a flag. I approve.\nI shall return when the mildew thickens and the air grows damp.\n— William T. Wet Sock\nHose Recovery Division, HOA Disruption Task Force\n“If it drips, it speaks.”"
