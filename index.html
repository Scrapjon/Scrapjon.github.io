        <h1>
            HELLO IT IS I!!! OLIVER MOLONEY!
        </h1>
        <p>You may know me from hit classics such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Dreamslayer</li>
                <li>The website you are currently on</li>
                <li>And many others!</li>
            </ul>
            I believe I am a special kind of person... one who is beyond mere words (apart from the good ones).<br>
            You think you're better than me?<br>
            You think you're SMARTER than ME?<br>
            THINK AGAIN!<br>
            I am sane and mentally stable.<br>
            <h2>You are beneath me!</h2><br>
            I am the fishmongerer who make fish the good fish<br>
            You the bad fish who mongered badly<br>
            I hope you will consider me for this job!<br>
            Your future employer,<br>
            Oliver :)
