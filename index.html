    <main>
        <p>You may know me from hit classics such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dreamslayer</li>
            <li>The website you are currently on</li>
            <li>And many others!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I believe I am a special kind of person... one who is beyond mere words (apart from the good ones).</p>
        <p>You think you're better than me?<br>
        You think you're SMARTER than ME?<br>
        THINK AGAIN!<br>
        I am sane and mentally stable.</p>
        <h2>You are beneath me!</h2>
        <p>I am the fishmonger who makes fish the good fish.<br>
        You are the bad fish who mongered badly.<br>
        I hope you will consider me for this job!<br>
        Your future employer,<br>
        Oliver :)</p>
